# Chat App

# Project Name: UNIverseChat

The goal of this project is to have students login to our website to chat with a LLM chat bot that has been trained on the entire selected degrees materials and text books as well as assignments. The student will be able to save and retrieve chats form a database. This way, they can review their learning progress and get feedback from the chatbot.

This is a full-stack MERN project that includes a chatbot, user accounts, and authentication. The project is designed to allow users to create accounts, log in, and start chatting. The chatbot is powered by a custom LLM model deployed on the backend. The project is built using MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, LangChain, Flask, and Docker.

The project uses MongoDB as a document database to store user information and chat history. Express and Node.js provide a web framework for handling requests and responses on the server side. React creates dynamic user interfaces on the client side using components and state management. LangChain provides an API for accessing the LLM model that generates chatbot responses based on natural language input. Flask serves as a bridge between LangChain and Express by sending and receiving data in JSON format. Docker containers simplify the deployment and management of the application.

## Requirements

- User accounts to save chats.
- User should have a username and a password.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
